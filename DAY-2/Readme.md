Book Application
Overview
This project is a simple demonstration of the Spring Framework. It highlights the use of interfaces, service implementations, and bean management using Spring annotations. The application simulates a book service that returns a list of book titles.

Detailed Explanation
Key Components
Interface (IBookService):

The interface defines a contract for book-related operations.
It ensures that any class implementing this interface will provide the defined methods.
Service Implementation (BookServiceImpl):

This class provides the actual logic for the book service.
It is annotated with @Service, which marks it as a Spring-managed bean.
The service returns a hardcoded list of book titles.
Main Class (BookMain):

The main class is the entry point of the application.
It initializes the Spring application context and retrieves all registered beans.
The book service bean is fetched and used to display the list of book titles.
Spring Concepts Demonstrated
Annotations:

@Service: Used to define a service component.
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext: Initializes the Spring application context and scans for beans.
Dependency Injection:

The BookServiceImpl bean is managed by Spring and retrieved from the application context.
This demonstrates how Spring eliminates the need for manual instantiation.
Employee Application
Overview
This project demonstrates property injection, external configuration management, and bean handling in Spring. The application represents an employee entity whose name is fetched from a configuration file and displayed as part of a greeting message.

Detailed Explanation
Key Components
Employee Class:

The class represents an employee entity with a single property, employeeName.
It is annotated with @Component, making it a Spring-managed bean.
The employeeName property is injected from an external configuration file using the @Value annotation.
Main Class (empMain):

The main class initializes the Spring application context and retrieves all registered beans.
The employee bean is fetched and used to display a greeting message.
Configuration File (application.properties):

This file contains the value for the employeeName property.
The @PropertySource annotation is used to specify the file's location, and the @Value annotation fetches the value.
Spring Concepts Demonstrated
Annotations:

@Component: Marks the class as a Spring-managed bean.
@Value: Injects property values into the bean's fields.
@PropertySource: Specifies the location of the configuration file.
External Configuration:

The application.properties file provides values for the employee bean's properties, allowing flexibility and separation of concerns.
Dependency Injection:

Spring handles the instantiation and management of the Employee bean.
The main class retrieves the bean from the application context to use its functionality.
Common Concepts in Both Applications
Spring Context:

The AnnotationConfigApplicationContext is used to initialize the application context and scan for beans in the specified package.
Bean Management:

Both applications use Spring annotations to define and manage beans.
Separation of Concerns:

The logic for each feature is encapsulated in specific components (interfaces, services, entities), adhering to clean coding principles.
